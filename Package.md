# Ballerina Package for Testcontainers

The testcontainers package allows users to use the API defined at https://www.testcontainers.org/. This is mainly used in spinning up and communicating with servers (e.g. database, message brokers) when running tests. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required locally as a prerequisite.
